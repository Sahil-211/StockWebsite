# Overview of StockWebsite
This project uses ReactJS which I used to create two React elements. One element makes a graph of a chosen stock using the plotly extension in
ReactJS. This creates a graph by gathering stock prices and dates using an API. The data is JSON format and we take that data, put it into a array and use it with
plotly to create a graph. This element is called with the line ```<div id="NewsList"></div>```in grid 1 in the Home.html

The second React element uses another API to gather current news about the stock that is chosen. Then the news title and corresponding link is put into a list of
cards that can be scrolled through. This is called in grid 2 using ```<div id="NewsList"></div>``` in Home.html

The build folder contains the production version of the code for creating the stocks graph (build command detailed below) and the NewsBuild folder contains the one for the list of news. These build folders are a result of running the build command in a React app folder.

To run correctly run everything you will need the NewsBuild, build, public, and src folders. You will also need the Home.html, about.html, package-lock.json, package.json, script.js, and styles.js all in a folder and then you can open Home.html in Chrome or another browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
